## Recommendations

- ✨ **Conny Dorrestijn**, Founding Partner BankiFi: *"Judit joined our team in its very early start up stage and has demonstrated everything one needs in a key professional: creativity, resilience, team spirit, imagination, dedication and heaps of skill. What impresses me most though is her personality. Busy as she is, there is always time to do more as she reaches out to other women and young professionals in search of motivation and guidance. A trooper with a great sense of humour, tenacity and dedication. So proud to call you my colleague!"* (February 2022)
